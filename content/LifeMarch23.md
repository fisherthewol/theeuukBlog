Hello all; it's been a while. My [last]({filename}/SantanderDNS.md) blog post was August 2022. Let's get an update.  

## Graduation.  
I graduated from the University of Hull on the 21st of July 2022. I attained a 2-1 in BSc Computer Science (Hons).  
The ceremony was pretty good; I was extremely nervous until the point I walked the stage, and that was kind of a daze to me. But otherwise, the ceremony was amazing; [Dame Sarah Gilbert DBE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Gilbert) received an Honorary Doctorate (her second Doctorate total) from the University during the ceremony, and gave an amazing speech.  
In terms of my results, I failed one module, but passed by condonement. A bit disappointing, but I graduated, and I both learnt from and enjoyed my time at University. In terms of whether I'd recommend Hull? Yes. The quality of teaching was great, the cost of living was cheap (although that might be different now), the night life (well, Spiders and Welly) was great, and it's flat, which means it's great for cycling.  
I'd also specifically recommend the following modules (Although some modules have been shuffled and/or removed):  

* 600085 Embedded Systems Development
* 600087 Languages and their Compilers
* 500089 Electronics and Interfacing
* 500080 Database Techniques
* 500081 Networking and User Interface Design (although this was a mandatory module for me)

As a whole, put it this way: I've gone back to Hull for a night out since I graduated, and I plan on coming back again. It feels like the back-arse-of-beyond, but **it is** the back-arse-of-beyond, and that's what makes it fun.  

## Work.
After Graduation, I applied for a few jobs. I heard back from a few, and I ended up going for an applicant day with [The Access Group](https://www.theaccessgroup.com/en-gb/). They called back about two days later to offer me the role. So I started my career!  
I took part in a 6 month graduate scheme, where I learned Typescript and React[^1], brushed up my C#, learnt how to use the Agile Methodology in Practice. I'm enjoying React a lot more than I thought I would; the little bit of functional programming I've learnt has made me really enjoy React Hooks and the composability of React Components.  
After the end of the graduate scheme, I was meant to move into my permanent team; however our stay on the team we got put on in January has been extended, so I'll be starting in April.


[^1]: Which is something I never thought I'd say; Javascript and frontend in general.... scared me? More I didn't think I had the graphical ability; but with internal frameworks, that hasn't been issue.
