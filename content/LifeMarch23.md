Hello all; it's been a while. My [last]({filename}/SantanderDNS.md) blog post was August 2022. Let's get an update.  

## Graduation.  
I graduated from the University of Hull on the 21st of July 2022. I attained a 2-1 in BSc Computer Science (Hons).  
The ceremony was pretty good; I was extremely nervous until the point I walked the stage, and that was kind of a daze to me. But otherwise, the ceremony was amazing; [Dame Sarah Gilbert DBE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Gilbert) received an Honorary Doctorate (her second Doctorate total) from the University during the ceremony, and gave an amazing speech.  
In terms of my results, I failed one module, but passed by condonement. A bit disappointing, but I graduated, and I both learnt from and enjoyed my time at University. In terms of whether I'd recommend Hull? Yes. The quality of teaching was great, the cost of living was cheap (although that might be different now), the night life (well, Spiders and Welly) was great, and it's flat, which means it's great for cycling.  
I'd also specifically recommend the following modules (Although some modules have been shuffled and/or removed):  

* 600085 Embedded Systems Development
* 600087 Languages and their Compilers
* 500089 Electronics and Interfacing
* 500080 Database Techniques
* 500081 Networking and User Interface Design (although this was a mandatory module for me)

As a whole, put it this way: I've gone back to Hull for a night out since I graduated, and I plan on coming back again. It feels like the back-arse-of-beyond, but **it is** the back-arse-of-beyond, and that's what makes it fun.  

## Work.
After Graduation, I applied for a few jobs. I heard back from a few, and I ended up going for an applicant day with [The Access Group](https://www.theaccessgroup.com/en-gb/). They called back about two days later to offer me the role. So I started my career!  
I took part in a 6 month graduate scheme, where I learned Typescript and React[^1], brushed up my C#, and learnt how to use Agile Methodologies in Practice. I'm enjoying React a lot more than I thought I would; the little bit of functional programming I've learnt has made me really enjoy React Hooks and the composability of React Components.  
After the end of the graduate scheme, I was meant to move into my permanent team; however our stay on the team we got put on in January has been extended, so I'll be starting in April.  

## Personal Life.
I recently turned 22. <del>Immediately I lost all my hair, got back pain, and started to dislike the youth.</del> I kid, although I did sleep funny and hurt my neck almost immediately after my birthday.  
I'm still friends with most of my friends from School. University I've only really got a few friends from. I've made a few friends at work, which is good. Access says (something like) they value people over performance, which from the outside sounds like corporate spiel, but my experience has been that it is, in fact, the truth.  

I've upgraded my PC; I've gone from a i7-4790k to a R5-7600X. The difference is staggering and I'm glad I did, but I made the mistake of paying the early-adopter tax, and massively overpayed for the parts.  
My old things have gone to my grandma, who is enjoying the upgrade.... from an i3-2120! That was running 8GB of DDR3-1600, in single channel, and a 2TB harddrive with no SSD. So, relatively substantial for her. The single channel RAM makes me severely doubt the abilities of Dell; I appreciate it's a desktop machine, but come on, dual channel is a basic concept!!  

When I started this job, I had to commute to the office; I started cycling and getting the train (public transport gang ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤). This reignited the love for cycling I gained in my last months in Hull. However, I've since become essentially fully-remote, and so I have not had the opportunity to cycle so much. I'm wrestling with this: it feels pretty good to cycle, but my current bike doesn't make it easy, but I don't cycle enough to justify buying myself a new bike.  
Similarly I am debating joining a gym; it's a debate between the monthly/OpEx of the gym, vs the CapEx of buying weights; even if I do buy weights, I don't have room anywhere for machines.... Hmm. Something to think about.

[^1]: Which is something I never thought I'd say; Javascript and frontend in general.... scared me? More I didn't think I had the graphical ability; but with internal frameworks, that hasn't been issue.
